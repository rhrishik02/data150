This article describes the drivers and correlates of human population distribution across low/middle income countries. Specifically, the article hypothesizes that geographic factors including climate, topography, and transportation links among others will have a significant correlation with human population distribution which in turn can shed light on poverty assessment and analysis as the UN predicted that human population growth would occur in significantly more impoverished areas across the world. The authors proceed to use different data analysis techniques using machine learning algorithms to quantify the importance of these factors across 32 low and middle income countries. Poverty assessment and analysis becomes extremely complicated as it can involve every level of society ranging from internal factors such as local political and economic policy to global factors such as geography and international trade. Thus, using data science to analyze the influence of geographical factors in driving poverty through human population distributions becomes an attractive solution to understanding the fundamentals surrounding poverty analysis. After conducting each analysis, the authors concluded that urban areas and climatic/environmental factors were the most significant in predicting population density and thus allows for quantifiable analysis of poverty within regions. Their analysis sheds light on the identification of poverty by showing how variables like urbanization extent, elevation, resource proximity, crop/vegetation land cover, and more can drive population growth. Ultimately, if scientists can better understand these factors that contribute to population growth, high-resolution mapping of poverty and construction/preparation for future development scenarios can be achieved. 

This article relates to Senâ€™s definition of freedom by describing a solution for a removal of a major unfreedom which is poverty. In this instance, an analysis and potential solution is depicted to better understand and predict poverty through human population distributions using data science techniques. Sen says that the removal of major sources of unfreedoms is crucial for development and understanding how various geographical factors contribute to human distribution is conducive to that goal of mitigating an unfreedom and promoting development.
