This article describes the drivers and correlates of human population distribution across low/middle income countries. Specifically, the article hypothesizes that geographic factors including climate, topography, and transportation links among others will have a significant correlation with human population distribution which in turn can shed light on poverty assessment and analysis as the UN predicted that human population growth would occur in significantly more impoverished areas across the world. The authors proceed to use different data analysis techniques using machine learning algorithms to quantify the importance of these factors across 32 low and middle income countries. Poverty assessment and analysis becomes extremely complicated as it can involve every level of society ranging from internal factors such as local political and economic policy to global factors such as geography and international trade. Thus, using data science to analyze the influence of geographical factors in driving poverty through human population distributions becomes an attractive solution to understanding the fundamentals surrounding poverty analysis. After conducting each analysis, the authors concluded that urban areas and climatic/environmental factors were the most significant in predicting population density and thus allows for quantifiable analysis of poverty within regions. Their analysis sheds light on the identification of poverty by showing how variables like urbanization extent, elevation, resource proximity, crop/vegetation land cover, and more can drive population growth. Ultimately, if scientists can better understand these factors that contribute to population growth, high-resolution mapping of poverty and construction/preparation for future development scenarios can be achieved. 

This article relates to Sen’s definition of freedom by describing a solution for a removal of a major unfreedom which is poverty. In this instance, an analysis and potential solution is depicted to better understand and predict poverty through human population distributions using data science techniques. Sen says that the removal of major sources of unfreedoms is crucial for development and understanding how various geographical factors contribute to human distribution is conducive to that goal of mitigating an unfreedom and promoting development. 

Targeting poverty through quantifiable and analytical means is being addressed by the authors research. This is an important dimension of human development as 9.2% of the world is in extreme poverty while a significantly larger portion lives in need of at least some basic necessities. By better understanding factors that contribute to human population growth, it becomes easier to identify development implementation for the future.

No poverty, Industry/Innovation/Infrastructure, and Sustainable Cities and Communities are all sustainable development goals that are related to the article. If human population growth can be better understood, development methods for reducing poverty, effective infrastructure usage, and maintaining living standards in cities and communities can be achieved. 

The authors sample census data from 32 low and middle income countries in 4 regions around the world at an average spatial resolution of 100 km^2 or below. In their analysis, they used intensity of night-time lights, energy productivity of plants, topographic elevation and slope, climatic factors, type of land cover and presence/absence of roads, water features, human settlements and urban areas, protected areas, and locations of points of interest (POIs) and facilities such as health centres and schools as predictive covariates of population growth. 

The authors employ random forest-based population models to conduct their analysis. They describe RF’s as a non-parametric, nonlinear statistical method that falls within a category of machine-learning methods known as ‘ensemble methods’. Ensemble methods take individual decision trees that are considered ‘weak learners’ and combine them to create a ‘strong learner’.

The scientists are seeking to answer the question, “What factors correlate and drive human population distributions in low and middle income countries?”

This article seeks to find a modern and more effective method of mapping poverty by taking advantage of phone and satellite data. In this study, the authors base their claim on the idea that current metrics of poverty are predicated on outdated census data, and instead employ data science techniques using commonly available public and private data from mobile phones and satellites in hopes of providing insight into the spatial distribution of poverty. By using new techniques to update the accuracy of poverty maps, it becomes possible to to understand the causes of poverty as well as methods of poverty alleviation for development purposes. Specifically, the authors use remote sensing and geographic information system (RS) data as well as call detail records (CDR) to accurately map poverty. Poverty mapping is an integral part of poverty assessment and analysis as it allows scientists to accurately identify what exact areas or regions will be affected by lack of resources while also providing a streamlined framework for allievations concerning development purposes. Conclusively, the researchers successfully used RS and CDR data to compile poverty maps with significant accuracy as their models were able to successfully produce high-resolution maps that were based on various data factors. 

Based on Sen’s definition of development as freedoms and the mitigation of unfreedoms, this article relates to the idea of alleviating poverty as an unfreedom through increased awareness and knowledge of poverty as a result of compiling poverty maps using RS and CDR data. By having access to modern data that can be updated in real time as opposed to census data, poverty mapping from RS and CDR data will prove to be a valuable tool that can be used for efficient development purposes and alleviation.
