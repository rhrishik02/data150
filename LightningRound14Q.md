1. Owen Barder defines development as a property of the economic and social system itself. In other words, development is not only an increase in economic output, but the emergence of a system of economic, social, financial, legal institutions, firms, products, and technologies that together provide liberties for people to live happy and fulfilling lives. 

2. Barder compared these 2 countries to highlight the idea that there are multiple reasons outside of just income per person that result in economic growth. The exploration of these facets and contribution to development is what allowed for the transformation of peoples’ lives in South Korea. 

3. The toaster project was an attempt by Thomas Thwaites to create a toaster from scratch. This process took 9 months to complete and he ultimately was successful for 5 minutes as he did not have rubber to insulate the copper and it blew up shortly after being plugged in. His attempt demonstrated the idea that an economy is not simply economic output but rather the emergence of an interdependent system in which individual components allow citizens to live happy and fulfilling lives. 

4. A simplified model that said to make a unit of output, a certain amount of capital and labour would be necessary. According to the model, a firm would be able to increase its output if it was able to increase its capital or labour or both. Walter Rostow published the Stages of Economic growth which claimed that development is a virtuous circle. Rostow hypothesized that if investment was increased by 10-20%, a developing country could launch into a self-sustaining cycle. 

5. The Harrod-Domar model did not necessarily represent reality. Thus, Robert Solow introduced the Neoclassical Growth Theory model that introduced a third component on top of labour and capital which was technological change. When technological change is combined with labor and capital, output would increase. While his model matched the data, it was more of a counting method than a model. His model had an extreme emphasis on technology which was not always the correct reason countries developed at higher rates. 

6. Ajaokuta Steel works was one of the largest investments in steel production that cost more than 5 billion US dollars. The reason it was unsuccessful was poor management and corruption. Thus the emphasis shifted from policies to institutions, though the specific institution that causes growth is still unspecified. Acemoglu and Robinson argue that mainstream development practice today is built on an incorrect assumption that poor countries are poor because their rulers have mistaken views on how to run their country thus stopping the markets from working correctly. Rather, it is because it suits the ruler of the country to run it in that way. 

7. According to Barder, traditional economic models have a hard time explaining why some countries experience rapid economic growth while others don’t. The exploration of each of these “missing ingredients” have not succeeded as the ideal indicator. 

8. The significance of Shumpter’s idea is that long-term assumptions must be destroyed to create space to foster innovation and progress. This relates to firms as no one-standing theory of the economy should be seen as the end all be all. Instead, the theories should be deconstructed and allowed to be made new. 

9. A rich set of interactions between a very large number of adaptive agents all of which are co-evolving. A complex adaptive system’s defining features are difficult or impossible to predict in detail (butterfly effect), an ability to make broad generalizations about the system as a whole rather than individual, emergent properties, tend towards greater complexity, and not tend towards an equilibrium. 

10. Halle Sellasie was the last emperor of a feudal dynasty in Ethiopia. The Emperor's significance is that it described in great detail the life of Selassie and provided insight about why Ethiopia was stuck in a poverty trap.
